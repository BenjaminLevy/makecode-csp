Once your group has your assignment, each member should read over the description of the example. When everyone is finished reading the description, you should discuss the following as team:

* What is the goal of the project?
* What is the embedded system/device being used?
* What types of sensors are used?
* How is artificial intelligence helping (if used)?
* What's next for the project?
